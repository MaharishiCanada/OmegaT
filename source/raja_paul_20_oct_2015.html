Dear Canadian Governors, and Sidhas, and Mediators,
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
Congratulations on your participation in the national initiative to increase our numbers meditating and flying together, and coordinating our program times, in the days leading up to and including the Canadian national elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
We are so fortunate to have from Maharishi this precious technology to generate a powerful and far-reaching influence of harmony and coherence in collective consciousness. We are the only ones with this ability, and so it is our joy of responsibilty to make use of it as we have done so well during the elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
We congratulate our new Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, and hope that his administration will be the one that adopts all of Maharishi’s precious programs to bring fulfillment to all aspects of Canadian life. We look forward to applying Maharishi’s Total Knowledge more and more in all fields, to create a very bright future for Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
With all best wishes.
</span></p>
