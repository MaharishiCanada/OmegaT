Dear Governors and Sidhas of Invincible Canada,
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
We have a unique ability to create a powerful influence of coherence in collective consciousness though our group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhis programme. We also have the joy of responsibility to apply these powerful technologies especially in times of particular need.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
On many occasions over the years, in many countries, Maharishi has encouraged us to fly together in groups to generate a supportive influence of national coherence during the days of national elections.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
A suggestion has come from a number of our Canadian Governors that we rally together to organize nationally coordinated flying times, as well as larger groups flying together, in each city this weekend and especially on national election day, Monday, October 19, to create the positive ground for the most evolutionary outcome of Canada’s national elections. 
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
By consensus, we have established national flying times of 7:30 am and 6:00 pm in each Canadian time zone. We encourage all our Sidhas and Governors to join together in the Centres for group programmes during these days leading up to the election, and especially on election day. In locations where Centres are not yet established, a number of Sidhas are making their homes available for these events.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
Meditators are warmly welcome to participate at these times with their own separate programme as well.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
Please be in touch with your Centre leaders to participate together in this important and joyful event to generate an influence of coherence supporting a bright future for Canada.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#0433FF;">
With all best wishes.
Jai Guru Dev
